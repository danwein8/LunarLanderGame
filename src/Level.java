/**
 * Procedurally generated levels: the length and width of the tunnel, along with the variation of the walls
 * will be based on the difficulty.
 * Idea behind procedural generation / Invariant: the way this level generator is going to work is it will take
 * into consideration the entire rectangular space, length by width, and divide it into a grid. the grid will always
 * consist of three rows (based on the current design idea, subject to change), these rows will mainly be based on 
 * the average width of the tunnel. The average tunnel width is the width of the tunnel when the variation = 0 on
 * both ceiling and floor, higher difficulty scales this value down and the variation value up. So a tunnel of that
 * width will be put in the middle of the screen, so the y value at average tunnel width/2 == width/2. then the
 * remaining width on either side will be used for the ceiling and floor boundaries. The columns will be a set value,
 * something like 16 or 32, if I find a sprite or tile I want to use for the walls then that will be the value.
 * Now I just need to use the x and y values from the grid spots that hold walls in my random number generator
 * and then run that value thru the procedural generator algorithm and I will know exactly how much the walls vary
 * by, I can also have gaps in the wall if that looks good, procedural generation is versatile.
